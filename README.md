# My 2D Game Adventures ðŸŽ®

Hey there! Welcome to my personal 2D Game Projects repository! ðŸš€ This is where I document my journey into the exciting world of game development through various 2D game experiments and projects.

## What's Inside:

- **Learning Playground:** Dive into my learning journey with a collection of 2D games. From the first line of code to the final build, each project captures a different aspect of my growth as a game developer.

- **Messy Code, Neat Lessons:** You'll find everything here â€“ messy code, breakthroughs, and lessons learned. It's the real, unfiltered experience of someone exploring the wonders of game development.

- **Tech Stack Variety:** I like to dabble in different technologies and frameworks. Each project is a small exploration using a variety of tools, from classic game engines to quirky libraries.

## How to Explore:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/SaiHarish820/2D-Game-Projects.git
   ```

2. **Choose Your Adventure:**
   Browse through the "Projects" directory to find a game that catches your eye or resonates with your learning goals.

3. **Learn with Me:**
   Each project comes with documentation where I share my thoughts, challenges, and the occasional "Aha!" moment. Dive in, explore the code, and let's learn together!

4. **Share Your Insights:**
   If you stumble upon a better way to do things or have suggestions, I'd love to hear from you. This is a learning space, and collaboration makes the journey even more enjoyable.

## Project Folders:

- **/Projects:** Home to all my 2D game projects. Each folder is a chapter in my learning adventure.

- **/Notes:** Random notes, thoughts, and doodles. It's my digital scrapbook of game development musings.

- **/Resources:** Shared assets and resources because we all know the struggle of finding that perfect sprite.
